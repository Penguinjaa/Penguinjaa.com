If it took itself a bit more seriously I would like it a lot more. But the elements i do like, i really like!! The <i>demon and alien</i> stuff is cool, and all of the creatures designs are great. Some standouts are <i>Episode 7</i> with <i>Acrobat Silky</i>, that episode was great!!! I also really liked in <i>Episode 12</i> the creatures in the woods outside Jiji's house, that shot of them was really creepy and effective!! Speaking of <i>Jiji</i>, I was worried he was gonna suck but this last episode redeemed him in my eyes, him wanting to be friends with okarun is nice. <i>Overall</i>, i enjoyed this more than i expected to, the sillyness isnt particularly for me but the more serious elements made up for that.",
