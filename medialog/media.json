I was listening to him in middle school when he was a white youtube rapper doing ksi diss tracks, and now hes making me cry dude it's insane. His production just keeps getting better, I thought IDMTHY was crazy but this is like actual goat territory. I honestly cannot imagine anything else dropping this year that can top this.<br><br>First off, the theming of this album is just so good and creates an incredibly unique soundscape, it just transports you into the boat with fog covering the ocean. The part on Casper where it sounds like its going in and out of the water is so cool, actually gives me goosebumps every time. I think this just makes for an incredible concept album, I can't think of any other album that feels so thematically tied in the with the sound that doesnt come across as forcing it.<br><br>I'm writing this a week after first listen and I've been obssessed with this all week, I had to of cried like 10 times listening to this all week it just is so well put together and holds so much emotions. The production and the lyrics are just top notch I need to stop talking about it I will be here all day.<br><br>If you havent listened or if you have but havent seen the movie, you NEED to watch the movie it adds so much to the album. standout visual moments for me are THUNDRRR, FORGONE, and CASPER.

This is easily top 10 nintendo ALL TIME it is their best platformer (even better than sm64) and most important of all it is SO CHARMING!!!! Oh my god i love this game it has that same specialness to it that gamecube era games have, I havent had this much childlike wonder in so long. All of the little NPCs with dynamic dialogue based on what youve done are so cute. Like at the beginning there is this one monkey saying everything is gonna be okay and dont panic then you punch him and he starts freaking out and all the other monkeys next to him freak out too. The Feast Kingdom especially gives gamecube energy, it reminds me of Pinna Park from Mario Sunshine. I am a pretty big pauline hater normally, but this game has changed me forever im fake and I switched up, this game made me like her more. I was a little worried that the more disney esque elements would be cringe and weigh down the game, but I actually really liked it, it works and is cute. Obviously the destruction is really satisfying, you can tell they put a lot of time into perfecting the feel of it.<br><br><i>REAL SPOILERS AHEAD!!! FINAL WARNING!!!</i> The last parts of the game are super super cool I was soyfacing and pointing at the screen when K. Rool showed up. In Odyssey I wasnt a fan of new donk city just cause the switch couldnt render enough to make it look good, but it looked really good in this game. I'm really happy they didnt show off K. Rool and all of the bananzas in the trailers, I feel like nintendo and most companies show way too much in trailers and theres no surprises while playing, but they didnt do that here. The elephant bananza is really good they really did everything possible to make it the most satisfying it can be.",

If it took itself a bit more seriously I would like it a lot more. But the elements i do like, i really like!! The <i>demon and alien</i> stuff is cool, and all of the creatures designs are great. Some standouts are <i>Episode 7</i> with <i>Acrobat Silky</i>, that episode was great!!! I also really liked in <i>Episode 12</i> the creatures in the woods outside Jiji's house, that shot of them was really creepy and effective!! Speaking of <i>Jiji</i>, I was worried he was gonna suck but this last episode redeemed him in my eyes, him wanting to be friends with okarun is nice. <i>Overall</i>, i enjoyed this more than i expected to, the sillyness isnt particularly for me but the more serious elements made up for that.",
