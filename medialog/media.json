BEWARE!!!</i> i honestly didnt really like this movie sorry sports fans. it gave me the same feeling you get from reboots of classic tv shows that completely miss the mark idk!! also the animation in this one is different and looks really weird i cant quite put my finger on it but the characters looks weird. they also use cgi too much and it looks goofy. there were some tropy lines as well like yelling <i>activate</i> when starting the ship or the eva was silly more of a nitpick but didnt like it regardless. there are still elements i like but overall not a massive fan. as for the whole series (so far) i think it is sorta a waste. the 2nd movie was really good but the first was alright and this one was kinda bad. it had to be a lot more rushed since its condensed into movies but i feel like they focused on the <i>wrong parts</i> sometimes leading to the characters not being as likable. for example, i was already not really a fan of <i>asuka</i> in the show but her one redeeming quality to me wasnt really touched on in the movies. she never really talks about her personal issues and is just a brick wall the whole time. i get theres another movie but still feels like that should have been introduced by now. yeah i could probably go on for a while about why i dont like it but i dont wanna so yeah sorry. maybe im just an <i>eva old head</i> and im blind to the new school hip movies i dont know",
