                        <p>its been a while since ive done a journal esque thing on here. this is going to be pretty long and sporatic, might not even post it we will see teehee.</p><br>
                        <p>ive been frustrated with this site because i put too much pressure on myself with it for no reason. i dont do blog posts because i can be pretty bad at getting my thoughts out in a coherent manner. but at the same time i am frustrated with myself because i made this website and i love this website but i never use it for anything besides logging movies and as a homescreen for my browser. i think doing this journal every week or few days will help a lot.</p><br>
                        <p>i also have been pretty disatisfied with my layout, i like the core of what i have but i need to rely on it less and make different pages unique. none of my pages are distinct from the rest and i dont like it. i want it to be more fluid, instead of it being lego blocks just pieced together to make every single page.</p><br>
                        <p>its not all bad though, i have been testing the waters with new layouts, and i am getting back into zen and monklike stuff. i used to go to the gym with my friend since i dont have a car but he stopped taking me so i stopped going. but i took the bus there this week and started reading the berserk manga on the way and it was nice. i think i would like to make a habit of that.</p><br>
                        <p>ive also been thinking more about the things i hold onto, and what their significance is. for example, up until this month, i would almost constantly be on youtube. i was subbed to so many channels and rarely ever would run out of stuff to watch. but recently i cleared out my sub box, now im only subbed to the channels i truly care to watch and now i watch a lot less youtube. thats kinda why im here, cause i want to actually process my thoughts instead of just letting them race by while i listen to music or watch youtube. i watched this really good video about music addiction and it made me think about the reasons i listen to music. its an interesting topic that id like to write in more detail about another time. i have a lot of things i wanna write about, im pretty excited to use this journal.</p><br>
                        <p>anyway, just a quick vent of the stuff ive been feelings lately. this is really incoherent, the future logs wont be like this, just needed to write this stuff out.</p>
