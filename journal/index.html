                <p>yello everynyan!!! we're reaching the end of the year, meaning im gonna power through this new layout. i'd like to get it out for the new year, its been too long. im just really struggling to fill the home page, i need an epiphany of how to better lay out and display stuff while looking good. i finally fixed some disparity between my pc and laptop, so hopefully should look the same across most devices.</p>
                <p>new fortnite season is out, and its kinda rough. the game is fun, but wow lots of bugs and bad ui decisions. and they FINALLY added a pinkpantheress emote and they messed it up!!! its for illegal and its just that stupid tiktok trend so its just a handshake emote with illegal playing over it, its so bad. especially cause its pinkpantheress she literally has so many options for good emotes she has so many dances. tonight would be literally perfect, so im hoping we get more emotes or maybe even a skin please epic please.</p>
                <p>last night me and my buddy just sat in a call while he looked for music and it was very nostalgic, we used to sit in calls all the time and just do silly stuff like that all the time. its inspired me to kinda calm down about all the life stuff going on and really get back to where i was last year.</p>
                <p>at this point, im just so excited to have this website finished so i can use it properly, eventually these journal entries will be much smaller. i want to give less site updates and more just stream of conscious stuff like this one. my old journal was so joyous, i might even port it over here.</p>

                <h2>IM GONNA LOVE ME</h2><p><i> // 10.16.25</i></p>
                <p>Hey yall, I am back in my groove! Hopefully this will be my final push into finishing this site makeover. It's gone on way too long and its not even that special. I am currently listening to <i>GOOD Fridays by Kanye</i>. Very nostalgic collection of songs, if ur a kanye fan i highly recommend you revisit these. Power remix especially.</p>
                <p>I've decided to simplify the layout for the journal to just basic html now. I want this page to feel pretty simple, both to fit the journal vibe, and because I feel like a lot of my site strays pretty far from that old web aesthetic that I fell in love with in the first place.</p>
                <p>All that negative stuff in the last post has passed I think. I sorted out the hacking stuff and I got all the evil out of my system regarding the cheating stuff and now I'm happier than I was during the relationship, thanks to my friends.</p>
                <p>Recently me and my buddies have been playing <i>Tekkit</i>, which I knew I would be nostalgic for me but didn't expect how much. It's been very cute playing this version of minecraft that I probably have played more than any version and I just havent revisited it since it was the newest version. I'm shocked by how hard it is too, I've become spoiled by newer versions, all of us are dying a lot. This is a call for action to start a Tekkit server of your own!!</p>

                <h2>FANCY CLOWN</h2><p><i> // 10.8.25</i></p>
                <p>Its been a while again, this time with good reason though! Been having a rough few months, we'll get into that but first, I am currently listening to <i>man at the garden by Kendrick Lamar</i> and trying to cope with life stuff. Havent done much since last update.</p>
                <p>Let's just get into it. I have just had bad thing after bad thing happen to me recently. The biggest thing, I wont get into it too much but I got cheated on. It was a long distance thing though so what can you do. I wont linger on it, I'd rather pay attention to the other stuff around it. I got my first job and had it for 4 days before quitting. Really bad timing on my part, didn't think I would deal with such a rough breakup right before my first day, and couldn't handle both things at once so I quit. At least it broke the ice on getting a job.</p>
                <p>I also got hacked while this was happening, wonderful timing yet again. I'm pretty good with this stuff and didn't do anything stupid like download a random exe or whatever, so idk how it happened. It must have been some token grabber thing cause my discord has 2FA. My best guess is my firefox account got hacked or an extension I had installed had a token grabber. My firefox account was logged into, whether thats a result of the hack or the cause of it idk. so warning to you all I suppose. keep your browser account secure and be weary of what you let get synced.</p>
                <p>I also got sued for that car accident I was in a couple years ago. Its my dads insurance so it doesn't directly affect me right now, but when I get another car and need insurance it's gonna be expensive.</p>
                <p>ENOUGH NEGATIVITY!!!!!! I've had some good things happen too. Firstly, I got a RTX 3080 so now I can play games in 1440p woohoo! I also got a new chair, much comfier and better for my back. And as a result of the breakup, i've reconnected with some old friends and it's really the only thing making me actually happy. I can be an emotional little lesbian sometimes and I actually teared up happy tears cause it felt nice to talk to these people again. Anyways thanks for reading and checking up on me! Heres hoping things get better from this point forward!</p>

                <h2>V5.55 PROGRESS REPORT 2</h2><p><i> // 7.6.25</i></p>
                <p>Wow I cannot believe that last entry is from <i>7 months ago</i>!!!! I still remember writing it like it was a month ago but I suppose ive been a bit of a busy bee. I am currently listening to my <i>website playlist</i>, mostly daft punk and the synthy kanye songs, as well as lupe fiasco's food & liquor, ive been obsessed with that album lately.</p>
                <p>I mentioned in the last entry that I was really happy with the <i>media log</i>, but I guess that was a lie cause I completely re-did it again and now I think I am actually happy with it. I'm especially a fan of the <i>grid/list</i> view option, I think I've found a good middle ground of being able to write long reviews for stuff but not feeling forced to so the page wont look empty.</p>
                <p>I also rewrote the <i>vinyl page</i>, I never put it out the way it was but I wrote it in like a fugue state a year ago and it was really poorly made. it looked really good though so I finally came back and rewrote it and now it works on all displays (i think) and looks super cool. its themed after this game called <i>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</i>, I highly recommend you play it if you havent I promise you will love it.</p>
                <p>I'm finally starting to get somewhere with the home page, but I often change my mind we will see. Even if I redesign it again, I've implemented some stuff im really happy with. I'm using <i>Lanyard</i> to pull information from my discord account to display on my profile section. Which means my profile picture, status, and activity is pulled from my discord. It's actually really cool and ive had my eye on it for a bit but never looked into putting it on my site until now.</p>
                <p>The <i>Switch 2</i> came out since last writing as well and I'm really really liking it. <i>Mario Kart World</i> is super fun the free roam surprised me with how much time I'm spending in it. I think I'm at 50 hours or something? Very VERY excited for <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i>, that game looks incredible.</p>
                <p>As far as my personal life goes im pretty geeked!!! I've been talking to my buddies a lot and I feel like I've cultivated a more positive social circle for myself, a lot less evil sinister spirits coming to stab and kill me. I also helped my buddy make a <i>portfolio website</i> for her college class, <a href="https://tealtea.art" target="_blank">heres the link</a> if you wanna check it out.</p>

            <div id="entry1" class="entry">
                <h2>v5.55 PROGRESS REPORT</h2><p><i> // 11.24.24</i></p>
                <p>the <i>journal</i> is back!!!! a couple months ago, I got pretty fed up with my current website, so I wanted more <i>blog posts</i> or just personal writing in general on here. but I dont like the idea of muddying up my blog with just life updates, since I wanna use the blog for more project stuff like my crt media center raspberry pi. so I decided to add a journal again which I had on my very ugly <i>v1.11</i> of this website. hopefully now less ugly and more cool.</p>
                <p>anyway, I just intend to ramble about life on here, and share <i>amazing vibes!!!</i> right now im listening to that <i>new kendrick album</i> and taking a brief break from javascript. as of right now, the home page is (mostly) done, and the journal and media log are completely done. im pretty happy with how the <i>media log</i> turned out especially, I now have a section to write about the movie or whatever so I can give my thoughts. I did have this before but I wasnt able to find a way to fit reviews and make it look good/be functional. now that im trying to make most pages <i>unique</i> instead of just piecing them together like legos, I was able to make it work.</p>   
                <p>also, I moved the <i>theme switcher</i> into buttons that sit on the bottom right of the header. OH and I havent mentioned the marquee!!! I mentioned earlier that I got fed up a couple months ago with my layout, but I was struggling to make a new one I liked. then I had an idea to make a <i>red lcd marquee</i> like the one from the akira screenshot I use as a banner for the <i>neo-tokyo</i> theme. im really happy with how it turned out, I think its a really cool way to display some information, and its fun to include a randomized splash text.</p>
