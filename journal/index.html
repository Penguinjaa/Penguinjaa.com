                        <p>welcome to my <i>journal</i>. this is a place for me to just yap about stuff on my mind.</p>

                        <p>wow i cannot believe that last entry is from <i>7 months ago</i>!!!! i still remember writing it like it was a month ago but i suppose ive been a bit of a busy bee. i was slacking on website updates for a bit i had a big motivation burst at the beginning of the year and then stopped mostly until a month ago and ive been slowly sprinkling updates.</p>
                        <p>i am currently listening to my <i>website playlist</i>, mostly daft punk and the synthy kanye songs, as well as lupe fiasco's food & liqour, ive been obsessed with that album lately. i mentioned in the last entry that i was really happy with the <i>media log</i>, but i suppose that was a lie cause i completely re-did it again and now i think i am actually happy with it. i still need to figure out where to put some buttons and stuff but its turning out really nice so far. especially a fan of the <i>grid/list</i> view option, i think ive found a good middle ground of being able to write long reviews for stuff but not feeling forced to in order to not make the page look empty.</p>
                        <p>i also rewrote the <i>vinyl page</i>, i never put it out the way it was but i wrote it in like a fugue state a year ago and it was really poorly made. it looked really good though so i finally came back and rewrote it and now it works on all displays (i think) and looks super cool. its themed after this game called <i>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</i>, i highly recommend you play it if you havent i promise you will love it.</p>
                        <p>ive been really really trying to figure out how i want the home page to look, and i think im finally starting to get somewhere, but i change my mind so often we will see. maybe ill be writing here in a year still not decided who knows. but even if i redesign it again, ive implemented some stuff im really happy with. im using <i>lanyard</i> to pull information from my discord account to display on my profile section. which means my little profile picture is pulled from my discord, it shows a little dot with my discord online status, and it even will display the game im playing if i have one open. its actually really cool and ive had my eye on it for a bit but never looked into putting it on my site until now. i dont think ive seen someone do this before at least on nekoweb or neocities, but i would highly recommend you try it!!!</p>
                        <p>as far as my personal life goes im pretty geeked!!! ive been talking to my buddies a lot and i feel like ive cultivated a more positive social circle for myself, a lot less evil sinister spirits coming to stab and kill me. the <i>nintendo switch 2</i> came out since last writing as well, i know there was a lot of controversy but i didnt care at all i bought it day 1 of course and im really really liking it. <i>mario kart world</i> is super fun the free roam surprised me with how much time im spending in it. i think im at 50 hours or something? 100%ing it is gonna be a challenge but im most of the way there. very VERY excited for <i>donkey kong bananza</i>, that game looks incredible. i also helped my buddy make a <i>portfolio website</i> for her college class, <a href="https://tealtea.art" target="_blank">heres the link</a> if you wanna check it out, i think its epic and she cooked.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="entry1" class="entry">
                        <h2>v5.55 PROGRESS REPORT // 11.24.24</h2>
                        <p>the <i>journal</i> is back!!!! a couple months ago, i got pretty fed up with my current website, so i wanted more <i>blog posts</i> or just personal writing in general on here. but i dont like the idea of muddying up my blog with just life updates, since i wanna use the blog for more project stuff like my crt media center raspberry pi. so i decided to add a journal again which i had on my very ugly <i>v1.11</i> of this website. hopefully now less ugly and more cool.</p>
                        <p>anyway, i just intend to ramble about life on here, and share <i>amazing vibes!!!</i> right now im listening to that <i>new kendrick album</i> and taking a brief break from javascript. as of right now, the home page is (mostly) done, and the journal and media log are completely done. im pretty happy with how the <i>media log</i> turned out especially, i now have a section to write about the movie or whatever so i can give my thoughts. i did have this before but i wasnt able to find a way to fit reviews and make it look good/be functional. now that im trying to make most pages <i>unique</i> instead of just piecing them together like legos, i was able to make it work.</p>   
                        <p>also, i moved the <i>theme switcher</i> into button that sit on the <i>bottom right</i> of the header. OH and i havent mentioned the marquee!!! i mentioned earlier that i got fed up a couple months ago with my layout, but i was struggling to make a new one i liked. then i had an idea to make a <i>red lcd marquee</i> like the one from the akira screenshot i use as a banner for the <i>neo-tokyo</i> theme. im really happy with how it turned out, i think its a really cool way to display some information, and its fun to include a randomized splash text.</p>
