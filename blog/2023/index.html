							<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR FREAKS! 2023 was my zen and monklike year, I think this has been a good year and I got a lot done! I starting taking better care of myself both physically and mentally. I started going to the gym and stopped drinking soda and whatnot! I started waking up earlier and trying to go outside more and have some kind of routine and I picked up some new hobbies. MOST IMPORTANTLY I deleted instagram and twitter! I also got my drivers license but I got in an accident so uh yeah idk but other than that this year has been pretty fantastic.</p>

							<p>2023 was the first full year I've had this website!! This place looks a lot different than it did a year ago I had no idea how to make a website and I didnt have an aesthetic I wanted to go for. I didn't even know what Neocities was for petes darn sake! This is what it looked like at the beginning of the year.</p>
							<img src="1.png" style="width: 100%;"/> <p>(the other tabs were not cooler)</p>
							<p>For most of the year, my website kinda stayed looking like that since I didnt work on it much due to no inspiration or knowledge. But then on 7.26.23, my friend <a href="https://loevi.art/" target="_blank">LOEVI</a> sent me a link to <a href="https://dimden.dev/" target="_blank">dimden's hotel</a> and it (along with other neocities sites I found that same day) inspired me to revamp my website. I took a lot of inspiration from Dimden's site since I loved it so much (and you definitely can still see that inspo now) and made this layout that week.</p>
							<img src="2.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
							<p>I remember being so happy with this layout and getting that currently playing tab thing to work. I continued to improve upon this layout for a few months, until it looked like this.</p>
							<img src="3.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
							<p>I liked this layout, but I wanted something cooler. I spend a lot of time looking at neocities sites and there are so many cool people there with great layouts and I felt like this one was silly in comparison to them. I still love this layout though cause it was how I learned most of what I know about coding now and is one of the only projects I actually finished.</p>
							<p>In December, I began thinking of ideas for a new layout, and coded it all on the night of December 31st. hash tag NewYearNewMe! I went with darker colors and a more condensed layout with the intention of having less pages, but each page is a unique layout, which I am still working on. I am honestly really proud of this layout, I still have some gripes since you are your own biggest critic but this is definitely a big step in the right direction for me!!</p>

							<p>This was a big year for music for me, I branched out to a lot of different genres and I really started my vinyl collection. I listened to a lot of the new Lil Yachty album, I love that album so much!! Because of that album I started listening to Tame Impala too, who is also amazing. There was also the new Quadeca album which was very good. I also dipped my toes into some jazz, especially japanese jazz, which ive been enjoying a lot too. Since this was my zen and monklike year, I listened to a lot of music I found to be mentally/creatively fulfilling, You can see the zen and monklike playlist below!!</p>
