			<h1>NEW YEAR, NEW LAYOUT</h1>
            <sub>01.01.26</sub>
            <p>2025 is finally over!!! penguinjaa.com finally has a new layout!!! tell your friends!!! It's only right to kick this new year off with a long blog post, I have a lot to talk about. Before talking about the new layout, I wanna do my normal end of year reflection, so if ur interested in hearing my thoughts on music this year and what ive been up to, keep reading! if u want to hear about the new sexy layout, keep reading! (just scroll past the autistic ramblings)</p>
            <h2>2025 MUSIC</h2>
            <p>If you're a fan of hiphop, you already know this list is a tough one this year. So much good music came out this year, and I want to acknowledge most of it, so I'll have some honorable mentions at the end. PLEASE check out any album on this page if my description sounds interesting to you. This has not been an ordinary year for music, and it's very exciting. I'm just doing it by what came out this year, so if ur wondering where GNX is, it's my AOTY of last year!</p>

                    <h3>5. DON'T TAP THE GLASS - Tyler, The Creator</h3>
                    <p>This is basically Tyler's GNX and I adore that. Super replayable, super west coast, and has Tyler's creativity all over it. I loooooove talk boxes and they are all over this album. It was also mostly a surprise drop so I was very geeked when I saw it come out, I love those feelings.</p>

                    <h3>4. Stardust - Danny Brown</h3>
                    <p>I was surprised by this album, I'm a fan of Danny Brown, but none of his albums have captured me as much as this one. Of course Atrocity Exhibition is a classic, and is probably due for a relisten, but I dont come back to it that often. This album has sent me down a rabbit hole though. I've not only listened to this album a lot, but it introduced me to a lot of artists as well. It finally pushed me to listen to that Jane Remover Record and I also listened to an underscores album and I plan on getting to the other features soon. So I'm a big fan cause it's a great album and introduced me to a lot of new music</p>

                <h3>3. Let God Sort Em Out - Clipse</h3>
                <p>I'm sure you're not surprised seeing this here, it's the most critically acclaimed album this year for a reason. I don't even know how to describe this, it feels straight out of the 90s without sounding outdated or anything. It feels completely fresh but also classic, like actual definition of an instant classic.</p>

            <div class="ranking">
                <img src="/medialog/images/albums/fancy_that_pinkpantheress.jpg">
                <h3>2. Fancy That - PinkPantheress</h3>
                <p>Fancy That is by no means the most conceptual or genius album ever made, but I'd be doing it a disservice if it wasnt top 3 with how much I listened to it this year. PinkPantheress is like my favorite artist and person on the planet she is so cool and so goated and theres no one quite like her today. Every track is 10/10, I've prob played this more than any other album this year.</p>

            <div class="ranking">
                <img src="/medialog/images/albums/vanisher_horizon_scraper_quadeca.jpg">
                <h3>1. Vanisher, Horizon Scraper - Quadeca</h3>
                <p>Ironically, my #1 spot is not a hiphop album, but it's no surprise Vanisher is taking AOTY for me. I've been a fan of Quadeca since middle school. I was listening to Voice Memos when it came out which was a pretty basic white boy rap album and that's what I was into back then, and now he's dropping these crazy beautiful genre bending albums. If you have not listened to this, DO IT!!! And watch the album movie on his youtube channel, it enhance the experience even more.</p>
                <p>Quadeca has kinda quietly been becoming one of the most interesting musicians I listen to, and I'm glad to see that get more recognized over this past year. I saw a lot of positive discussion about this record this year, as well as his production/features on Kevin Abstract's 'Blush' and Danny Brown's 'Stardust'. Dr. Dre even praised Quadeca's production on Red Light which is just super cool to see. But it's really no surprise, he's great at producing and this album is the perfect example. It transports you into its world like no other album i've listened to.</p>
                <p>A few months past it's release, I'd have to say my favorite tracks are DANCING WITHOUT MOVING, MONDAY, and THUNDRRR. But also my favorites change all the time. CASPER is incredible, probably the best produced track of the year, I still get chills listening to it.</p>
