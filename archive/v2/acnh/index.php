									<h2>Welcome to my ACNH Blog!</h2>
									<p>This blog will document my re-playthrough of Animal Crossing New Horizons. I am planning on going for an Akira theme for my island, sorta an industrial, futuristic tokyo type of vibe (im white).</p>
								</div>
								<div class="column" id="mainbox">
									<h2>Day 1 (9/1/23) - Fresh Beginnings!</h2>
									<p>I gotta say goodbye to my old island, which isnt too hard cause I never really did much with it, and I am really excited to finally put the effort in to make a good island!!!</p><p>I think I got a pretty good island layout, the town hall is I think perfectly in front of the airport and I like the location of everything. I got Hamlet and Renée as my starting villagers, I immediately looked up if starting villager can leave cause Renée is NOT ALLOWED on my new beautiful island! i like hamlet tho. Since im going for an Akira theme I named my island Neo-Tokyo.</p>
									<img src="image0.jpg" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"/><p class="subtitle">My first night with my new buddys (and Renée)</p>
									<img src="image1.jpg" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"/><p class="subtitle">My #drip for the first day. went with a red look because kaneda from akira!</p>
									<img src="image2.jpg" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"/><p class="subtitle">Hamlet being nonchalant and whatnot</p>
									<p>Since I started last night today is technically the second day (sorry im a filthy liar) I was able to get the museum today and got my 15 donations!!! tomorrow will be my big day! I also got enought miles to get a house tomorrow then its pretty much go time! Also, I cleaned up all the weeds I could, I dont have the ladder yet so just the bottom layer for now.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="column" id="mainbox">
									<h2>Day 2 (9/2/23) - Building The Store</h2>
									<p>I forgot that the museum takes a day for construction so no donations today, but I did choose a spot for the shop! I had to buy 2 nook miles tickets to get all the materials for it, and neither of them had good villagers (which is good I think cause I dont think i couldve gotten them to move to my island yet?) I found Sydney and Al, both are ugly and STINK!</p><img src="image3.jpg" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"/><p class="subtitle">UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY </p>
									I got my house built though but still no shop so not really any good furniture yet. I did get this cute flower sign from a balloon i popped though!</p>
									<img src="image4.jpg" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"/><p class="subtitle">Cute lil sign</p>
									<p>Oh and as im sure you noticed, yes I did get some red rain boots to match the akira theme good job noticing that!</p>
									<img src="image5.jpg" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"/><p class="subtitle">This little freak washed up on my shore</p>
								</div>
								<div class="column" id="mainbox">
									<h2>Day 3 (9/3/23) - Filling the Museum</h2>
									<p>Okay, the museum is open for real now!!! I got a lot of fish and bugs yesterday while waiting for the museum, here is the #haul</p><img src="image6.jpg" style="width: 100%"/><p class="subtitle">Roughly 60 fish & bugs</p>
									<img src="image7.jpg" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"/><p class="subtitle">me and my besties</p>
									I also paid my debt off last night so my house is a little bigger now! I decided to go with a black roof idk if ill stick with that or not though</p>
									<p>Also I got the 3 house plots placed down! I tried to put them somewhere I would maybe want them but I'll probably end up having to move them, I should probably make a map of what I want as a final idea in photoshop or something</p>
								</div>
								<div class="column" id="mainbox">
									<h2>Day 4-10 (9/4/23-9/10/23) - Constructing Houses and New Friends!</h2>
									<p>I finished furnishing the houses! I also went to an island and met a blue goat I dont love him but hes good enough so I invited him to Neo-Tokyo.</p><p>The blue goat i met yesterday moved in today! His name is Sherb. The other 2 plots also got villagers moving in I didnt ask for them to move in so thats kinda sad. I got Sprinkle and Fauna. I flew to an island and it was a cherry tree island so now i have cherries and peaches which are the 2 most #aesthetic fruits so im a happy camper!</p><p>Sprinkle and Fauna moved in, I dont love either of them but Fauna is ok for now. I also built the campsite and upgraded the town hall. The past few days have been pretty slow while I wait to get to the part where I have to grind for K.K. Slider.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="column" id="mainbox">
									<h2>Day 11-16 (9/11/23-9/16/23) - Constructing More Houses and More New Friends!</h2>
									<p>It's go time!!!! I gotta grind for K.K. Slider now and that means I get 5 more villagers. I used an amiibo card to get Rosie since shes in my New Leaf town and I quite like her! unfortunately thats the only amiibo card I have that I like, so I had to go to islands and stuff and hope for the best. On my first island, I got Sasha and I like him! I think hes a newer villager cause his design is pretty unique so I think I'll keep him around. My next island had Lucky, who I dont love but I am fine with and is better than letting some random freak move in like another villager that I will rant about momentarily. The 9th villager i got was Frank. I've never had him before but I dont really like him all that much, so I will remove him when I can. But he is MUCH better than HIPPEUX!!! I got hippeux as my first campsite villager and as far as I know, theres no way to not let them move in? Maybe if I used an amiibo card while he was in the campsite but I didnt know where the cards were that day. So unfortunately I am stuck with this disgusting freak for the time being. </p>
									<img src="image8.jpg" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"/><p class="subtitle">Hamlet got stuck...</p>
									<p>Aside from the villagers, I have been slowly getting decorations for the island, im starting to get some good decorations for the industrial vibe im going for. I also got the Able Sisters building so now getting clothes is a whole lot easier. And today I'm going to start planning out the layout of my final island!</p>
									<img src="image9.jpg" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"/><p class="subtitle">My island before edits</p>

								<div class="column" id="mainbox">
									<h2>Day 17-22 (9/17/23-9/22/23) - Shooting For The Stars!</h2>
									<p>This will probably be the last (somewhat) frequent update. I have gotten all 10 villagers now and just need to decorate the island and such so I can get K.K. Slider. I added a sidebar thing that shows what villager I have/had/want. Fauna moved away and was replaced with Cephalobot. I like Cephalobot cause hes a robot and that kinda fits with the Akira/evangelion theme I want but I dont think I'll keep him in the long term. Anyways, the next post here will be about K.K. Slider, then after that I will just give occasional updates about how the design of the island is going.</p>
